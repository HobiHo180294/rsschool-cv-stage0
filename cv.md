# BRIEF INFORMATION ABOUT MYSELF

### My name is Yehor Potebenko and I am a student of Dnipro University of Technology, Faculty of Information Technology, Specialty of Computer Science. To begin with, I have been studying computer science for about two years, and during this time I managed to get acquainted with many programming languages and areas of Information Technology. I had been looking for myself in the field of IT for a very long time and only last year I finally decided to progress in the field of front-end development. Now this is an integral part of my life and my main goal is to become highly qualified specialist and work in an international company.

<br />

### In order to achieve my goals, I look for any opportunities for self-development and never miss them. Therefore, I entered RS School because I saw such a chance in evolving my knowledge and practical sklls of working on real projects to start my professional career as a junior frontend developer in the international IT company EPAM in future. Moreover, I am interested in gaining skills in software development and web applications not only in my motherland but also abroad. That is why I have recently applied for admission to Reutlingen University in Germany.

<br />

1. ### **Programming languages:** JavaScript, PhP.

<br />

# CODE EXAMPLES

<br />

# WORK EXPERIENCE

### Unfortunately, I have no commercial experience in programming. However, I am a versatile person and used to work as a freelancer where I was engaged with copywriting. I had been working as a copywriter from 01.07.2020 to 30.09.2020 and my work was based on writing texts for online stores in Russian, Ukrainian and English. Nevertheless, nowadays I devote most of my life to programming, because I want to start a career in this area.
