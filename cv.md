# BRIEF INFORMATION ABOUT MYSELF

### My name is Yehor Potebenko and I am a student of Dnipro University of Technology, Faculty of Information Technology, Specialty of Computer Science. To begin with, I have been studying computer science for about two years, and during this time I managed to get acquainted with many programming languages and areas of Information Technology. I had been looking for myself in the field of IT for a very long time and only last year I finally decided to progress in the field of front-end development. Now this is an integral part of my life and my main goal is to become highly qualified specialist and work in an international company.

<br />

### In order to achieve my goals, I look for any opportunities for self-development and never miss them. Therefore, I entered RS School because I saw such a chance in evolving my knowledge and practical sklls of working on real projects to start my professional career as a junior frontend developer in the international IT company EPAM in future. Moreover, I am interested in gaining skills in software development and web applications not only in my motherland but also abroad. That is why I have recently applied for admission to Reutlingen University in Germany.
